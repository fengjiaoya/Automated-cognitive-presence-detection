# Automated-cognitive-presence-detection-in-the-open-community-using-large-language-models

Goals: run the LLMs to classify messages according to cognitive presence categories and embed this function into the educational agent.

The motivation for this study stems from the need to improve the efficiency and accuracy of analyzing online learning environments. As highlighted by Hu et al. (2023) in their work on multi-label classifiers and cognitive presence in MOOCs, automated methods can significantly enhance our understanding and management of educational discussions.

Outcomes: Complete the experiment, a paper, and a prototype of the educational agent.

Desired Team Member Skills:
1. Proficiency in programming languages such as Python.
